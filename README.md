# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
This project is all about using JavaScript and APIs to map out earthquakes that have happened in the last 7 days. We used information from GeoJSON earthquake data to show where and how strong the earthquakes were.

## Aim
The goal of this project is to show how big or small earthquakes were in different parts of the world.

## Results
We used JavaScript and Leaflet.js to make a map with 3 different views: Streets View, Satellite Streets View, and Dark View. We also used D3.js to get the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We used Leaflet to put the data on a map and made interactive markers for the earthquakes. We made the markers different colors and sizes based on how strong the earthquakes were. We also added pop-up messages for each earthquake. We also made a legend to show the different colors and their meanings. We also got data on big earthquakes and tectonic plates and added that to the map. The final map looked like Figure 1.

## Outcomes vs Goals
We met our goal of showing how big or small earthquakes were in different parts of the world.

## Summary
In this project, we used JavaScript and APIs to map out earthquakes that happened in the last 7 days. We showed where and how strong they were and added information on big earthquakes and tectonic plates.
